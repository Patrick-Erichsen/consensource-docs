In today's ever changing environment, companies are continually challenged with keeping accurate records.  This ongoing record and data maintenance challenge is true across many facets of business, including keeping accurate records of certifications related to sourcing activities from where companies source their products and raw materials.  Even when these records are being provided via a website or some other electronic mechanism, they generally are not provided with the customer and recipient of those records at heart, making the ability to keep up to date and accurate records difficult, if not impossible.  

Meaning, the often antiquated and outdated way that certification records are provided to others creates an ever increasing challenge and risk to brands and retailers who not only desire and rely on accurate information, but also find this information critically important to their business.  Ultimately, the increasing push for transparency and an increasingly high expectation from consumers is why we believe a change in how this information is captured and provided needs to be made on a broad scale.  ConsenSource aims to solve this problem.
